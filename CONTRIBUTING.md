# Tips on contributing

## First of all

Welcome to this repo from all the members! The repository is created by UNICT-DMI students **for** UNICT-DMI students (but not only!).
To contribute, you don't need to be an international champion of competitive programming, you can and are encouraged to do so even if you are a completely beginner.
In order to submit the best contribution, make sure to read the whole guideline.

If you have any doubt about contribution, feel free to contact [@Helias](https://t.me/Helias), [@aegroto](https://t.me/aegroto), [@Pierpaolo791](https://t.me/Pierpaolo791).

## Setup

1. Make sure you have **all** the requirements needed (listed in the [readme](README.md).)
2. **Fork** this repo (click the _fork_ button)
3. **Clone** your fork to your working machine (via `git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Telegram-DMI-Bot`)
4. **Add upstream** in order to sync your fork with the original repo (via `git remode add upstream https://github.com/UNICT-DMI/Telegram-DMI-Bot`)
5. **Create a new branch** this allows to add your changes without having merge conflicts when you make a Pull Request (via `git checkout -b <branch_name>`)

## Submit changes

After you've finished implementing your contribution in your local repo, you will need to submit your changes to your remote repository. Follow these steps:

1. **Add** your changes to your work tree (via `git add <name_of_file>`)
2. **Commit** the files you have just added (via `git commit -m "<small but informative message>"`)
3. **Switch to master** in order to push the updates without having conflicts (via `git checkout master`)
4. **Fetch** updates from _upstream_ (the original repo) (via `git fetch upstream`)
4. **Merge** updates from _upstream_ (via `git merge upstream/master`)
5. **Merge** your branch, which contains the updates, with master (via `git merge <your_branch>`)
6. **Push** your changes on your local repo (via `git push`)
7. **Finally make a PR** using the Pull Request button in your repository page.

## PR best practices

As a developer you might know that a piece of _code_ is never as good as a _**GOOD** piece of code_. The same applies with PR.
What makes a PR a **good** PR is not just what code you implemented, or what feature you added. So, what makes a good PR?

* It will be a complete piece of work that adds value in some way.
* It will have a title that reflects the work within, and a summary that helps to understand the context of the change.
* There will be well written commit messages, with well crafted commits that tell the story of the development of this work.
* Ideally it will be small and easy to understand. Single commit PRs are usually easy to submit, review, and merge.
* The code contained within will meet the best practises set by the team wherever possible.

### Commit best practices

A good PR is obviously made up of good commits. Follow these steps to make good commits:

* **Make small commits.** If you have two bugs to fix, commit one fix at a time.
* **Commit complete and working code.** Never commit without testing your changes in a local bot instance.
* **Write explainatory commit message.** People and reviewers should understand what has been implemented in the commit from its title.
* **Use imperative style**. Even if at first it can seems a little strange, try to use **fix** and not **fixed** (same applies for every other verb)
* Follow the standards of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

### Conventional commits recap

Your commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

In particular, remember to include the type of the commit:

* Use **fix** when your commit fixes a bug or something that doesn't work properly. (Ex. fix(main): correct minor typos in code)
* Use **feat** when your commit introduce a new feature. (Ex. feat(home): add footer )
* Use **docs** when your commit introduce changes on documentation. (Ex. doc(contribution): add contribution guidelines)
* Use **style** when your commits format/add semi colons etc. (Ex. style(bot): replace space with tabs)
* Use **refactor** when your commits introduce reafactor/renames variables etc. (Ex. refactor(tests): replace all "pippo" varaibles with meaningful names)
* Use **test** when your commits introduce missing tests. (Ex. test(lezioni): implement test for lezioni covering 80% of the functions)
* Use **chore** when your commits introduce changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries. (Ex. chore(merge): solve conflicts)
